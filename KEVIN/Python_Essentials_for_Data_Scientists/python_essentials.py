# # Basic Data Types

# assignment statement
x = 4


# change the value of x
x = 5


# inner function runs first, outer function runs second
print(type(x))


# return value prints out automatically
type(x)


# integer
type(5)


# floating point
type(5.0)


# string
type('five')


# string
type("five")


# use double quotes outside in order to use single quotes inside
type("we've been here")


# boolean
type(True)


# boolean
type(False)


# # Lists

# create a list
nums = [5, 5.0, 'five']


# prints out the same way you input it
nums


# check the type
type(nums)


# count the number of elements
len(nums)


# get help on a function
help(len)


# get the first element
nums[0]


# change the first element
nums[0] = 6


# lists are mutable
nums


# check the type of the third element
type(nums[2])


# check the length of the third element
len(nums[2])


# append is a list method
nums.append(7)


# list was modified without an assignment statement
nums


# get help on a list method
help(list.append)


# get help on all list methods
help(list)


# extend is a list method
nums.extend([8, 9])


# list was modified without an assignment statement
nums


# plus sign means additions for numbers
1 + 2


# plus sign means concatenation for lists
nums + [10, 11]


# list was not modified
nums


# object can be on both sides of an assignment statement
nums = nums + [10, 11]


# list was modified through an assignment statement
nums


# # Exercise: Lists
# 
# 1. Create a list of the first names of your family members.
# 2. Print the name of the last person in the list.
# 3. Print the length of the name of the first person in the list.
# 4. Change one of the names from their real name to their nickname.
# 5. Append a new person to the list.
# 6. Change the name of the new person to lowercase using the string method 'lower'.
# 
# After each change, check that it worked.

# # Solution: Lists

# exercise 1
names = ['Wesley', 'Larry', 'Wan']


# exercise 2
names[2]


# exercise 2 using negative indexing

# # Comparisons & Conditional Statements

x == 0


# you can use logical operators: and, or, not
x > 0 or x == 0


# check for inequality
x != 0


# you can chain comparisons together
0 < x < 3


# conditional statements respond to conditions
if x > 0:

# first and third lines will always run, second line will run if condition is True
if x > 0:
    print('positive')
print('done checking')

# second line doesn't run since condition is False
