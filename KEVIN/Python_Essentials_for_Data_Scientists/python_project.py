# # Project: Part 1

# ## Project Overview
# 
# This project is a series of 7 exercises inspired by Veritasium's excellent 22-minute video, [The Simplest Math Problem No One Can Solve](https://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg).
# 
# If you have the time, I recommend watching the entire video right now! (Watching it now won't "spoil" anything about the project.)
# 
# But if you don't have the time, you can simply watch the short section of video related to each exercise before working on it! (I'll link to that section in the instructions for each exercise.)

# ## While Loops

x = 4


# if statement checks a condition, runs once
if x > 0:
    print('positive')


# for loop runs one or more times
for letter in 'hello':
    print(letter)


# while loop checks a condition, runs as long as condition is true
# condition should eventually become false
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1


# **Article:** [Python "while" Loops](https://realpython.com/python-while-loop/) (Real Python)

# ## f-strings

x = 4


if x > 0:
    print('positive')


# you can pass multiple objects to the print function
if x > 0:
    print(x, 'is positive')


# substitute an object into a string using an f-string
if x > 0:
    print(f'{x} is positive')


name = 'Kevin'


# call a method in an f-string
f'My name is {name.upper()}'


# use a function in an f-string
f'My name is {name}, which has {len(name)} letters'


# evaluate an expression in an f-string
f'Divide {x} by 3 to get {x / 3}'


# use a "format specification" to format a number
f'Divide {x} by 3 to get {x / 3:.2f}'


# **Article:** [Python f-string tips & cheat sheets](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/string-formatting/) (Python Morsels)

# ## Mathematical Operators

# addition operator
5 + 3


# subtraction operator
5 - 3


# multiplication operator
5 * 3


# division operator
5 / 3


# "true division" always returns a float
6 / 3


# "floor division" rounds down
5 // 3


6 // 3


# converting to an integer is equivalent to floor division
int(5 / 3)


int(6 / 3)


# round function rounds to the nearest integer
round(5 / 3)


# you can specify the number of decimal places
round(5 / 3, 2)


round(6 / 3, 2)


# modulo operator returns the remainder after division
5 % 3


6 % 3


7 % 3


# ## Project Exercise 1
# 
# This exercise relates to the following portion of the video: [0:00 to 3:31](https://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg?t=0).
# 
# Define a function called `path()` that accepts one required argument called `start`. (We are requiring `start` to be a positive integer, but your function doesn't need to validate that it's a positive integer.)
# 
# Within the function, do the following:
# 
# - Create a list called `nums` in which the first element is `start`.
# - Check if `start` is odd or even:
#     - If odd, then multiply by 3 and add 1.
#     - If even, then divide by 2. (Make sure the result is an integer, not a float.)
#     - Append the resulting number to `nums`.
# - Repeat this pattern until you reach the number 1, and then stop.
# - Print out `nums`, which should start with `start` and end with 1.
# - Use the `max()` function to calculate the maximum number reached, and print that out.
# - Print out the number of steps it took to arrive at 1. (Inputting the starting number does not count as a step.)
# 
# For example, if you run `path(10)`, it should print out this:
# 
# ```
# path: [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
# max: 16
# steps: 6
# ```

# ## Solution to Exercise 1

# import Counter class from the collections module
# class names usually start with capital letter
from collections import Counter


# call Counter class, get back a Counter object (an "instance" of Counter)

# **Article & Video:** [What is a class?](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-is-a-class/) (Python Morsels)

# ## Counter

# pass an iterable to Counter, it counts how many times each element appears
# an iterable is anything you can loop through (string, list, dictionary, etc.)
Counter('hello')


# count how many times each integer appears in the list
Counter([1, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1])


# Counter acts similar to a dictionary since it's a subclass of dict class
c = Counter([1, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1])

# - For each integer 1 through `end`, calculate the first digit of every number in that path.
# - Tally up all of the first digits across all of those paths.
# - Return a sorted list of tuples, in which the first element of each tuple is the digit and the second element is how many times that digit appeared.
# 
# For example, `count_first_digits(3)` should return `[(1, 5), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (8, 1)]`.
# 
# Hint: You can start with an empty Counter.

# 
# Define a function (with a docstring) called `percentage_first_digits()` that accepts one required argument called `end`, which is a positive integer.
# 
# This function should convert the output of `count_first_digits()` from whole numbers into percentages of the total.
# 
# For example, the output of `count_first_digits(5000)` is this:
# 
# ```
# [(1, 116648),
#  (2, 67801),
#  (3, 45331),
#  (4, 48426),
#  (5, 31109),
#  (6, 20746),
#  (7, 21962),
#  (8, 21867),
#  (9, 19078)]
# ```
# 
# `percentage_first_digits(5000)` should instead return this:
# 
# ```
# [(1, 0.297),
#  (2, 0.173),
#  (3, 0.115),
#  (4, 0.123),

#  (6, 0.053),
#  (7, 0.056),
#  (8, 0.056),
#  (9, 0.049)]
# ```
# 
# Here's how I suggest writing the function:
# 
# 1. Save the output from `count_first_digits()`.
# 2. Get all of the numbers (1 through 9) into a list.
# 3. Get all of the counts into another list.
# 4. Calculate the total of those counts.
# 5. Calculate the percentage of that total for each count.
# 6. Zip the numbers with the percentages.

# ## Project Exercise 5
# 
# In the Bar Plots lesson, we created a list of tuples called `output`:
# 
# ```
# output = percentage_first_digits(5000)
# output
# [(1, 0.297),
#  (2, 0.173),
#  (3, 0.115),
#  (4, 0.123),
#  (5, 0.079),
#  (6, 0.053),
#  (7, 0.056),
#  (8, 0.056),
#  (9, 0.049)]
# ```
# 
# Then, we used list comprehensions to create the `nums` and `percentages` objects:
# 
# ```
# nums = [t[0] for t in output]
# nums
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# 
# percentages = [t[1] for t in output]
# percentages
# [0.297, 0.173, 0.115, 0.123, 0.079, 0.053, 0.056, 0.056, 0.049]
# ```
# 
# Your task is to create `nums` and `percentages` from `output` in a single line of code by using the asterisk operator and multiple assignment.

# ## Solution to Exercise 5

# goal: aggregate first elements into "nums" and second elements into "percentages"
output = percentage_first_digits(5000)
output


# list of nine tuples has become a list of two tuples

# - For each integer 1 through `end`, calculate the path that starts with that integer.
# - Return a dictionary in which each key is the starting number and each value is the maximum number reached during its path. (Use a dictionary comprehension for this.)

# ## Membership Operators

x = 2


# comparisons return either True or False
x > 0


x == 0


x != 0


# logical "or" returns True if either comparison is True
x == 0 or x == 1


x == 0 or x == 1 or x == 2


# preferable to use the membership operator "in"
# returns True if x is a member of the list
x in [0, 1]


x in [0, 1, 2]


# in operator works with tuples
x in (0, 1, 2)


# in operator works with strings
'science' in 'data science'


'I' in 'team'


word_length


# in operator checks dictionary keys
'science' in word_length


# in operator doesn't check dictionary values
7 in word_length


# not operator does negation
not True


not False


# "not in" membership operator is the opposite of the "in" operator
'science' not in word_length


'math' not in word_length


# membership operators are useful for conditional statements and while loops

# ## Project Exercise 7
# 
# This exercise relates to the following portion of the video: [14:34 to 15:09](https://youtu.be/094y1Z2wpJg?t=874).
# 
# Modify the `get_path()` function (and its docstring) so that the `start` argument can be any integer.
# 
# - If `start` is positive, the path should stop once it reaches 1.
# - If `start` is negative, the path should stop once it reaches -1, -5, or -17.
# - If `start` is zero, the path should only contain the integer 0.
# 
# For example:
# 
# `get_path(10)` should return `[10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`
# 
# `get_path(-3)` should return `[-3, -8, -4, -2, -1]`
# 
# `get_path(-9)` should return `[-9, -26, -13, -38, -19, -56, -28, -14, -7, -20, -10, -5]`
# 
# `get_path(-200)` should return `[-200, -100, -50, ..., -68, -34, -17]`
# 
# `get_path(0)` should return `[0]`

# ## Solution to Exercise 7
